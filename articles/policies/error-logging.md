# Error Logging Requirements

Error messages sent to the browser or otherwise accessible by the user must be kept as generic as possible with the full details going only to Application Insights.  This protects the security of the application while still allowing authorized users access to the details when needed for troubleshooting, analytics, alerting, and other appropriate uses.
