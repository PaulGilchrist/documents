* Description
  * Store data in a WORM (write once, read many) state. This state makes the data non-erasable and non-modifiable for a user-specified interval. Blobs can be created and read, but not modified or deleted, for the duration of the retention interval.  This capability adds native support for legal holds, and other secure document retention options.

## Code Scanning Static and Dynamic Active & Passive, OWASP top 10, SANS top 25, and remediation

* Description
  * Static code scanners are tools that integrate with a developers IDE (like Visual Studio, VSCode, etc), and analyze the source code looking for known vulnerabilities usually based off the [OWASP top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) or [SANS top 25](https://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors) lists.  Dynamic Passive scanners usually intercept traffic to and from the browser through proxy settings, watching and reporting on vulnerabilities found.  Dynamic Active scanners crawl a website actively attempting to exploit a know vulnerability, reporting when successful.

## Containers

* Description
  * Similar to how virtual machines virtualized the physical hardware from the operating system, containers are a virtualization technology that goes to a higher level of abstraction and virtualizes the operating system from the application.  Contains allow portability as no changes are needed to run a container on-prem, or on any cloud provider, and even across multiple cloud providers and on-prem simultaneously.

## Serverless Computing

* Description
  * Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model in which the cloud provider acts as the server, dynamically managing the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity.  Every request that comes in is services by its own resources for nearly infinite horizontal scalability.
